only toy that he likes it's so annoying because they're so messy and I have like Palm leaves all over the house [Applause] hi my name is Cassie Randolph and this is Rose oh we got a little meow and this is Gus it's good and you guys might know me from The Bachelor years ago my mom started fostering cats we would have them from when they were like four days old we'd have to bottle feed them you wake up like every two hours in the night first ones that we ever did that with were Rose and her brother Axel who my sister has Rose and we kind of trade them back and forth sometimes because we're we just love both of them we still kept fostering cats and I fostered Gus want to come say hi this is where he usually is all day long on my lap and they fight over me Gus loves attention and he is always in the middle of everything and Rose is very chill and laid back and she just likes to sleep a lot I think having two cats especially when they're younger is really important really helps them learn like etiquette I guess I feel like that's why they're good because they have each other to not like know not to bite too hard or not to scratch or and you kind of they need a playmate so for Gus plays on his own because Rose sleeps he bothers Rose this is the only toy that he likes it's so annoying because they're so messy and I have like Palm leaves all over the house I think the cats definitely run this house they dictate like when I leave the doors open when I have to come home this blanket is strictly for them I don't even use it I don't even really like it but they need it I think it's so important to Foster cats just because there's so many cats that need homes out there it's really sad they'll be living in these shelters and they need a home but I have to be careful when I Foster because I always end up keeping at least one so I've cut myself off for a while it might start again though I love it I just think having a cat in the house makes the house feel like a home there's just something about having like little animals running around that makes it feel so homey when I'm stressed and they're like calling me I'm like it takes everything else out of my mind or it's just nice to have a distraction from things sometimes or feel like something depends on you I don't have kids so I have cats Cassie it's time for would you rather would you rather be a dog or a cat rather be a dog or a cat I would definitely rather be a cat I don't think anyone would be surprised by that would you rather be able to read Gus and Rose's minds or never have to clean their litter box again I think I'd rather read their minds because I'm trying to get this litter robot litter box and I feel like that will really make it would you rather eat your cat's food for a month or sleep in their bed for a month oh they don't they sleep in my bed instead of sleep in their bed for sure would you rather let Gus be president for a day or Rose be president for a day I think Rose has more of a level head on her shoulders for sure Rose [Music] okay so we finally have Rose I had to go find her she's basking in the sun outside this is a living room this is probably the room we're in the most then I have all of their toys out on display Rose doesn't like to play as much as Gus she likes like little laser toys which I had one and it just broke Gus on the other hand I'll buy all these toys for him and he just wants to play with the Palm prom foreign I also bought these scratchers they love this scratcher and you can flip it over and put catnip in it and stuff and they love it um this one I thought it looked really cute um but they unfortunately don't like it as much as the other one should I try and put them in the stroller but sometimes they'll just like I'll find them sitting in here and I'm like do you want to go on a walk come here [Music] and then I'll zip them up usually I'll zip them up and then we can go on walks around the neighborhood and then that's when I look like the ultimate cat lady Rose it's fun you like this she's like where am I why am I in here this is the atrium this is our little outdoor space and the cats because they're not outdoor cats I like to let them have like a little bit of outdoor Freedom um so they'll come out here and bask in the sun Gus sometimes tries to scratch the wood on the floor and I'm like I don't know at least he scratches the wood and not my furniture this is where they nap this is their nap Zone in the warm sun with the breeze I wish I was a cat like every day because that's this is all they do they nap 18 hours a day okay so now it's time for tricks for charity and today we are donating to Kitty of angels which is actually where I fostered gusts from so it's very special to me they're a no-kill cat and kitten rescue we're gonna do some tricks for them or try to and since we have the palm fronds Gus is most likely going to do everything I I say ready Gus choose the palm frond ready guess spin in a circle look at you ready fight the Palm frogs [Music] ready guys wag your tail wag your tail there we go good job okay I think that's all the picks we got for a cat for today okay guys thank you so much for coming and hanging out with me and Gus and Rose um if you guys want to follow me on Instagram my handle is Cassie Randolph and also if you guys want to support a good cause for cats my sister and my friend Chandler have a little non-profit called house cat and they sell a bunch of really cute things and all of the profits go to different shelters all right Gus let's say goodbye leave your
